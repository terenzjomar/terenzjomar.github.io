I've had bad grades in Math myself, so take this with a grain of salt.

There's this AI agent named [Gauss](https://www.math.inc/gauss), made by [Math Inc.](https://www.math.inc), which is designed to make *formal proofs* out of generalized informal statements.

In English, that just means it takes in normal English and tells you why it's true in Math. Or Lean. It [writes code in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/). And Lean is a programming language for Math.

Now before you think this will replace mathematicians, what this thing does is just generating verifiable code *for* mathematicians themselves. It won't take away the act of thinking about how the theorems are supposed to work.

What's really impressive here, though, is the insane engineering it took behind the scenes -- reportedly thousands of agents, each one running at the same time, a web of pipelines working together 24/7 to finish a common goal.

This project would have taken more than just math experts and LLM engineers. It's the culmination of all the world's greats working together for a better tomorrow.

Stuff like this inspire me to get better at coding and software engineering in general -- not because of AI possibly taking over my job -- but because of all the people doing all these amazing things. It makes me want to be like them.
